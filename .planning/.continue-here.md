<current_state>
Milestone v1.3 is fully defined with roadmap, requirements, and research. No phase work has started.
The roadmap has 6 phases (22-27) covering 13 requirements across 3 categories (feedback, freshness, taste learning).
Ready to plan and execute Phase 22 (Feedback Data Layer).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- v1.2 milestone archived (commit f010330, tag v1.2)
- v1.3 milestone started (commit 62e898a)
- Research completed: 4 parallel researchers (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls) + synthesis
- Research files: .planning/research/{STACK,FEATURES,ARCHITECTURE,PITFALLS,SUMMARY}.md
- Requirements defined: 13 requirements (FEED-01..07, FRSH-01..03, LRNG-01..03) (commit 877ef41)
- Roadmap created: 6 phases (22-27) with success criteria (commit dd0d915)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

All 6 phases of v1.3:
- Phase 22: Feedback Data Layer (FEED-02) -- SongFeedback model, persistence, notifier
- Phase 23: Feedback UI & Scoring (FEED-01, FEED-03, FEED-04) -- like/dislike on SongTile, scoring integration
- Phase 24: Feedback Library (FEED-05, FEED-06) -- browse/edit feedback screen
- Phase 25: Freshness (FRSH-01..03) -- play history, recency penalty, user toggle
- Phase 26: Post-Run Review (FEED-07) -- post-run rating screen, home prompt
- Phase 27: Taste Learning (LRNG-01..03) -- pattern analysis, suggestion cards
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Binary like/dislike feedback (not rating scale) -- research confirms this is the standard
- Disliked songs hard-filtered (never appear again), not soft-penalized
- Freshness is user-controllable toggle ("keep it fresh" vs "optimize for taste")
- Taste learning surfaces suggestions, never auto-modifies taste profile
- Zero new dependencies -- SharedPreferences + pure Dart for everything
- SongQualityScorer extends with feedback dimension; freshness penalty in PlaylistGenerator
- Phases 24, 25, 26 are independent after 23; Phase 27 depends on 25

<context>
User wants the full scope: all feedback features + freshness + taste learning in v1.3.
Research was thorough -- 4 parallel agents covering stack, features, architecture, pitfalls.
Key research insight: single-user taste learning is frequency counting, not ML.
Key risk: filter bubbles with small catalog (5,066 songs) -- freshness must co-ship with feedback.
Model profile: quality (executor=opus, verifier=sonnet, researcher=opus).
