## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

- **Manual UI verification:** Onboarding flow, empty states, shuffle, profile switching
- **Pre-existing test failure:** widget_test.dart expects "Home Screen" text
- **User setup:** Add GETSONGBPM_API_KEY to .env before runtime API calls

### Blockers/Concerns
