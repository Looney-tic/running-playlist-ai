## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Supabase chosen as backend (research recommendation: relational data fits user-song-playlist model)
- GetSongBPM as primary BPM source (Spotify Audio Features API deprecated Nov 2024)
- BPM data pipeline is existential risk — validate in Phase 3 before building generation logic

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Spotify extended access requires 250K MAU + registered business. App limited to 25 users in dev mode. Apply early.
- GetSongBPM API rate limits and coverage gaps unknown until Phase 3 validation.
