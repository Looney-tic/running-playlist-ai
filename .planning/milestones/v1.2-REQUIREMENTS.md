## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for v1.2 milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Regeneration Reliability

- [x] **REGEN-01**: Shuffle/regenerate reuses stored song pool with a new random seed -- instant, no API re-fetch
- [x] **REGEN-02**: Playlist generation works reliably on cold start without null state crashes (race condition fix)
- [x] **REGEN-03**: When user changes run plan or taste profile via inline selector, next generate uses the updated selection

### Profile Polish

- [x] **PROF-01**: Deleting a taste profile shows a confirmation dialog before removal
- [x] **PROF-02**: All enum deserializers (RunningGenre, EnergyLevel, etc.) have orElse fallbacks to prevent crash on corrupt/unknown data
- [x] **PROF-03**: Multi-profile flows (create, edit, delete, switch, persist) verified with integration test coverage

### Onboarding

- [x] **ONBD-01**: First-run users see a guided flow: welcome -> pick genres -> set pace -> auto-generate first playlist
- [x] **ONBD-02**: User can skip any onboarding step and proceed with sensible defaults
- [x] **ONBD-03**: Home screen adapts based on whether user has profiles and run plans configured (context-aware empty states)

## Future (v1.3+)

- Spotify OAuth + playlist export (when Developer Dashboard available)
- Apple Music integration via MusicKit
- Song feedback loop (heart/flag per song -> scoring integration)
- Playlist freshness tracking (penalize recently played songs)
- Profile templates (pre-built profiles like "Chill Long Run", "HIIT Intervals")
- Social playlist sharing
