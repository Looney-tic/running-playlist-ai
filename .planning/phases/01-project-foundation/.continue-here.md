Executing Phase 1 (Project Foundation) via /gsd:execute-phase 1.

Plan 01-01 is COMPLETE (2/2 tasks, committed).
Plan 01-02 is IN PROGRESS — Task 1 committed, Task 2 is a checkpoint:human-verify waiting for user to test the app on all three platforms and verify Supabase connection.

The checkpoint requires the user to:
1. Fill in `.env` with real Supabase credentials (URL + anon key)
2. Create a `test_table` in Supabase (id int8 PK auto-increment, message text, RLS disabled)
3. Run `flutter run -d chrome` (web), Android emulator, iOS simulator
4. Verify navigation works, no Supabase errors in console
5. Report "approved" or describe issues
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Plan 01-01 Task 1: Create Flutter project with dependencies and linting - `640a64e`
- Plan 01-01 Task 2: App architecture with navigation and placeholder screens - `61bb727`
- Plan 01-01 metadata commit - `4aae047`
- Plan 01-02 Task 1: Configure Supabase connection and platform settings - `ec16116`
  - Updated main.dart with Supabase.initialize + dotenv
  - Added .env to pubspec.yaml assets
  - Verified Android internet permission
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Plan 01-02 Task 2: Checkpoint — user verifies app on web/Android/iOS with Supabase (WAITING)
- After checkpoint approved: create 01-02-SUMMARY.md, update STATE.md + ROADMAP.md, commit metadata
- After both plans done: phase verification (spawn gsd-verifier), update roadmap, offer next phase
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Riverpod 2.x used instead of 3.x (Dart 3.10 macro incompatibility with riverpod_generator)
- Manual Riverpod providers instead of @riverpod code-gen (same Dart 3.10 issue)
- riverpod_lint removed (analyzer_plugin incompatible with Dart 3.10)
- Flutter 3.38.9 installed via Homebrew during execution
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- User must complete Supabase setup and test the app before plan 01-02 can finish
</blockers>

<context>
Running /gsd:execute-phase 1 with quality model profile (opus for executors, sonnet for verifier).
Config is yolo mode. Two plans in phase, wave 1 (01-01 autonomous) done, wave 2 (01-02 with checkpoint) paused at checkpoint.

After user approves checkpoint, need to spawn a fresh continuation agent to create SUMMARY and metadata commit for 01-02, then run phase verification, update roadmap, and present next steps (Phase 2: Spotify Authentication).
</context>

<next_action>
Resume /gsd:execute-phase 1. The orchestrator should:
1. Present the checkpoint to user again (verify app on 3 platforms + Supabase)
2. After "approved": spawn fresh gsd-executor to create 01-02-SUMMARY.md, update STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, commit metadata
3. Run gsd-verifier for phase 1
4. Update roadmap, offer /gsd:plan-phase 2
</next_action>
