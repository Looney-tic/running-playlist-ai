<current_state>
Milestone v1.1 Experience Quality fully initialized. Roadmap created with 3 phases (16-18), 14 requirements mapped. Phase 16 has no plans yet — next step is to discuss or plan the phase.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- v1.0 milestone completed and archived (18/18 requirements, 229 tests)
- v1.1 milestone initialized via /gsd:new-milestone
- 4 parallel research agents completed (STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PITFALLS.md)
- Research synthesized into SUMMARY.md
- 14 requirements defined and approved (QUAL-01 thru QUAL-06, CURA-01 thru CURA-04, UX-01 thru UX-04)
- 3-phase roadmap created and approved (Phase 16: Scoring Foundation, Phase 17: Curated Running Songs, Phase 18: UX Refinements)
- GSD updated from 1.11.1 to 1.11.2
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 16: Scoring Foundation — not yet planned (QUAL-01 thru QUAL-06)
- Phase 17: Curated Running Songs — not yet planned (CURA-01 thru CURA-04)
- Phase 18: UX Refinements — not yet planned (UX-01 thru UX-04)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- v1.1 focuses on three pillars: song quality (runnability), curated data, UX flow
- "Runnability" is a first-class concept — what makes a song good to run to (danceability, beat strength, rhythm), separate from taste match
- No new pub.dev dependencies needed — all built on existing stack
- GetSongBPM `/song/` endpoint returns danceability (critical discovery from research)
- Scoring uses separate dimensions: running suitability vs taste match (not a single merged score)
- Curated data is a boost, not a filter — non-curated songs still appear
- Phase ordering: scoring (16) before curated data (17) before UX (18)
- Model profile: quality (opus for researchers/roadmapper, sonnet for synthesizer)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- GetSongBPM `/song/` endpoint danceability field needs empirical confirmation before implementation
- GetSongBPM rate limits for `/song/` calls undocumented — need testing
- Whether `/tempo/` endpoint already returns danceability is unknown — determines if enrichment calls are needed
</blockers>

<context>
User's vision: playlists should be genuinely great for running. BPM matching alone isn't enough — songs need to be proven good running songs, matched to taste, with easy stride adjustment and repeat generation.

Research found the Karageorghis framework (rhythm response > musicality > cultural impact > association) as the scientific basis for scoring. Danceability from GetSongBPM is the primary untapped signal.

Architecture approach: add a scoring layer to existing PlaylistGenerator._scoreAndRank(), don't restructure. New song_quality feature module with SongQualityScorer, RunningQualityIndex, CuratedSongsLoader.

Scoring weights from research: artist match +10, curated bonus +8, genre match +6, energy alignment +4, exact BPM +3, variant BPM +1.
